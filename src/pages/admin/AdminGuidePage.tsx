                      <li>Is it larger than 5MB? That's like trying to fit into your pre-holiday jeans‚Äîit just won't work. Try compressing it!</li>

                    <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                      <li>Is it marked as "Published" or "In Stock"? Unpublished products are like vampires‚Äîthey don't show up in reflections (or your storefront).</li>
                      <li>Did you assign it to a category? Products without categories are like lost tourists‚Äîthey exist but have no idea where they belong.</li>
                      <li>Does it have at least one photo? Even supermodels need headshots to get work!</li>
                      <li>Try the old "clear your cache" trick (it's the tech equivalent of "have you tried turning it off and on again?") or peek at your store in an incognito window.</li>

                    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
                      <li>The eternal "Did you hit Save?" question. It happens to the best of us! Look for that "Save Settings" button‚Äîit's not just decorative.</li>
                      <li>Your browser is being nostalgic for your old colors. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 on Windows or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)‚Äîit's like giving your browser amnesia about the past.</li>
                      <li>Are you looking at your actual live store? Preview modes sometimes wear last season's colors.</li>
                      <li>Mobile devices can be stubborn sometimes. Try checking on a desktop‚Äîthey're more adaptable to change.</li>

                      <li>The "Forgot Password" button is your friend, not an admission of failure. We use it weekly ourselves!</li>
                      <li>Try clearing your cookies and cache‚Äîthink of it as a spa treatment for your browser.</li>
